**@juliaroquette** Package under development for deriving Q&M indexes for Gaia DR3 light-curves.

**Last Update**: 22 January 2024



TO DO:

General:
- include sample of reference Q & M for Orion stars
- include sample of reference Q & M for synthetic light-curves
- include script file for reading light-curves and calculating Q & M. 


- gaia:
    - Add class for reading Orion Light-curves
    - Add Jupyter notebook for downloading Orion Light-Curves
- variability
    - Add .py with Q&M implementation
    - Add .py for filtering
    - Add .py for periodicity & timescales

- Jupyter notebook:
  - Waveform estimation section 
    - (Chloé to add info)
  - Filtering Section 
    - (Clhoé to add info)
  - Add examples of waveform for validation
