    "\n",
    "**@juliaroquette:** This notebook concentrates research-notes related to the implementation of a Python code for calculating Asymmetry and Periodicity indexes. These variability-indexes have been first introduced by [Cody+2014](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/147/4/82) and are used to quantify the degree of symmetry/asymmetry and of stochasticity/periodicity in light-curves of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Once calculated for a given light-curve, these indexes can be used to place the star in a QM-diagram (see figure below), threshold of the two indexes can be used for classification purposes and certain regions of the diagram can be associated to physical mechanisms behind the variability processes being observed. The two indexes can also be used as feature in Machine-Learning applications. \n",

This light-curve is called raw, but it has been already filtered for any needs deemed necessary by authors as pre-filtering before a period-search technique is applied. There is a lot of variation in what this filtering entails, hence see Filtering section below. Typical filtering will include $5-\\sigma$-clipping and de-trending for variability at longer timescales than resolved by the light-curve. For high-cadence light-curves filtering may also include a short-timescale filtering that helps focusing the period-search step.\n",

In general, this is a simple average of the uncertainties in the light-curve, considering the $\\sigma_i$s of all datapoints left in the filtered light-curve in step 1. However, a few studies derive a typical uncertainty value by looking at rms vs magnitude distributions for samples of less-variable stars in their survey (`C14`, `C18`, `C22`).
